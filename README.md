# NES Emulator
This project is an NES emulator written in Rust.

## Objectives
There were a few objectives with this project. Firstly I wanted to learn Rust and program a semi-serious project with it. Secondly, I wanted to use the knowledge from my Digital computers course. I've done both of these with this project and have a huge appreciation to the people who first made the NES.

## Todo
Unfortunatly there are some limitations with this project. It is a bit buggy. It does not work with all NES formats. And there is not Auditory Processing Unit (APU), and therefore none of the nostalgic soundtracks from these games. Hopefully these will be completed in the future.
